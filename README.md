The PDF file attached, contains text (paragraphs) as well as tables. 

pdf is Scraped using python, tabula and PdfFileReader.

I have parse the document and provide it in a structured JSON format which is inserted into mongodb and table into csv file. 

The parsed JSON is in a format such that it captures the hierarchy of the contents in the document.
